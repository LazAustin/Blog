            <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mt-2 py-2 text-yellow-500 underline">Short Version</h3>
            <p className="indent-10">My name is Laz Austin, the creator and primary contributor for this blog. I am a software developer from Jackson, Mississippi in the US. I am also a huge nerd who loves sci-fi (space operas mostly), superheroes, foreign languages (I’m multilingual) and culture, history (especially military), crazy genres of music (symphonic power metal anyone?), libertarian philosophy, playing the piano, martial arts, tending bar, cooking, reading, and of course my beautiful wife, Cathy. <p className="indent-10">Currently, this blog is the “everything bagel” of its kind. I may eventually split it into two or more focusing on specific subjects. But for now, I would like to write about tech issues and trends, political commentary from a libertarian perspective, non-fiction book reviews and how their theses challenge or contribute to libertarian thought and activism, Movies/TV reviews with a focus on the industry’s recent erosion by radical wokeism, song/album/band reviews focusing on my eccentric tastes which are rarely covered in the US, men’s lifestyle strategies and topics, and the occasional miscellaneous subject.</p></p>
            <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mt-2 py-2 text-yellow-500 underline underline-offset-4">Long Version</h3>
            <p className="">
              <p>I’ve always loved to write and been passionate about several subjects. It probably all started in middle school when I wrote a story about a large monster I called “Freakazoid” attacking our school. The teacher made us read our stories out loud, and to my surprise, the whole class thought mine was hilarious. Around the same time, I started reading voraciously: first with the Animorphs series, Lord of the Rings, and Harry Potter, then later with my dad's military fiction books laying around the house, starting with Dale Brown and moving on to Stephen Coonts, Larry Bond, Tom Clancy, and some Clive Cussler and others in-between. The military fiction books sparked a passion for history and international relations as I was constantly looking up details about the countries, cultures, and militaries of the conflicts involved. 
              </p>
              <p className="indent-10">Later, I wrote sports for a small newsletter in high school amongst my homework (book reviews being my favorite). At the time, I had just earned a 2nd Dan in Tang Soo Do and Associate Instructor certification but I was also exploring mixed martial arts and learning Ninjutsu. My Tang Soo Do instructor was a traditional martial artist who was stubbornly against mixing or learning new styles. Internally, I found myself debating the philosophical merits of the two approaches, culminating in a 20+ page research paper comparing Chuck Norris and Bruce Lee, who sort of represented both sides, for my final English project.
              </p>             
              <p className="indent-10">What do you often get when you cross interests in philosophy and history/international relations…? Politics! My growing interest and strong opinions led to a weekly column called “The Skunk Works” (named after the secretive Lockheed Martin think tank famous for developing the F-22, F-35, SR-71, etc)  in the university newspaper. To be honest, I’m not proud of the opinions I had and the articles I wrote in my early formative years. They were solidly neoconservative, uninformed, and dogmatic, but gradually shifted to libertarianism during the ‘08 election and Ron Paul Revolution. Philosophy and objectivity, an “empty cup” to use Bruce Lee’s phraseology,  had become important to me at this point, so I refused to just “go with the flow” of my upbringing, peer pressure (my home state is hardcore Republican), and the media. 
              </p>
              <p className="indent-10">While looking into ALL the candidates, I was shocked, like many, by the controversy around Ron Paul’s statements about 9/11 and Iraq. By then, I’d mostly shifted my reading to history, military, and politics non-fiction. And everything he said just…jived. After more investigation, I decided to join the Libertarian Party. I formed a county affilliate from scratch, consistently attended city council meetings, organized or participated in community events, campaigned for candidates, recruited new members, served briefly as Vice Chair for the MS Libertarian Party, and more. 
              </p>
              <p className="indent-10">If you haven't figured it out by now, politics is a passion of mine. That means many of the posts on this blog will be dealing with it, including those under seemingly unrelated topics. In a broader sense culturally, politics has also been infesting, and often ruining, many of my other passions, especially Hollywood and the music industry. In other words, this is not explicitly a political blog, but do no be surprised if many of the articles have overlapping categories.
              </p>
              <p className="indent-10" >I am also a big fan of reading. Perhaps the benefit of creating this blog I was most looking forward to was writing book reviews. While I still love a good novel, most of my reading is geared toward journalistic and scholarly nonfiction, preferably, but not always, politically neutral. I love to read for the simplistic goal of learning, of course. However, what is knowledge without application? It's important that I continuously challenge my beliefs, but I also hope to apply everything I read to libertarian thought and activism. How could this or that author's thesis be applied to the movement? To the Party's goals? To our philosophy and policies?
              </p>
              <p className="indent-10">To be clear, other subjects will rarely ever touch on politics. Musically, I have unique tastes that are very poorly covered in the US. I love all genres. Almost everyone says that, but I'm seriously not kidding. I could literally in one car ride, jump from girlpop to swing to rap to Spanish reggaeton to country to metal. However, I have a special place in my heart for obscure genres of metal, usually symphonic power metal. Metal is already extremely underground and non-mainstream, but within that, symphonic power metal is obscure within the overall metal genre. In the US, it's even less common and mainstream than the rest of the world. Personally, I believe the reason for that is a lack of classical music in standard education, but I digress. I hope in some small way to maybe change that and share the awesome sauce. 
              </p>
              <p className="indent-10">Men's lifestyle is another such subject. Intuitively, this topic has always fascinated me. Growing up, I was anti-social, awkward, sheltered, and shy. My parents were much older than normal and anti-social themselves. The school and church I went to were small (I graduated in a class of 7...yeah 7). I had high aspirations in life and cared deeply about my leadership skills, but when I went to college at 15 years old, I was in for a shock. I had a hard time socializing, working in groups, interacting with others, getting girlfriends, etc. While I couldn't put a name to it at the time, I eventually overcame my shortcomings and gained confidence in myself. After all, it has always been a priority for me to be the best man I can be. At one point, after a particularly rough breakup, I discovered Alpha M and a few other influencers who provided perspective on my own experiences and discover a whole new field of interest.
              </p>
              <p className="indent-10">Last but not least, as a software developer, I am intrigued and passionate about technology issues and trends. Most recently, I've been working with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). I also recently learned GraphQL and am currently learning Gatsby and Next.js. I started out learning Android development and still believe that might be my long term niche. New software comes out constantly in the development community and constantly needs to be evaluated. Developers never stop learning, which is one of the best things I love about this field. Moreover, new hardware and social trends chronically demand more of developers. AR/VR, electrical vehicles and smart TV's, Starlink, the "Internet of Things", Twitch, to name just a few, require new and better software and constantly change the game.

            <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mt-2 py-2 text-yellow-500 underline underline-offset-4">Short Version</h3>
            <p>This blog kills two birds with one stone. First, it is a core project in my software portfolio, built from scratch on the MERN stack by yours truly. Secondly, it provides an outlet and a platform for me to express my thoughts and views on a number of topics as described in detail in the content section below to provide readers with some context.</p>

            <h3 className="font-bold pb-2 text-blue-900">1. Software Portfolio</h3>
            <p className="">
            First, this is part of my software portfolio for potential employers. As such, it was a learning experience for me and one of the biggest projects I’ve done. Anyone can go on WordPress and create a blog in a matter of minutes, which I actually did for a while in college. However, I wanted another portfolio project and more coding experience, plus it is 100% customizable this way. It is a MERN Stack app (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) with Context for state management, Tailwind for styling, Emailjs for the contact form, BCrypt for authentication/authorization, TipTap for the text editor, and more. It currently has three models based on posts, users, and categories. Future ideas include adding tags, email verification, a dark mode, comments, and more, but I’ve decided to start posting on it for now and feeling it out as I go. After developing a rhythm, Next.js will be a must for better SEO and an awesome learning experience. like a new restaurant, however, I’m kind of approaching this like a “slow opening.”
            </p>
            <h3 className="font-bold py-2 text-blue-900">2. Content</h3>
            <p>This blog is also serving as my personal outlet and has been a dream of mine for years now. For the moment, it will cover all things I’m interested in. However, I might dedicate it mostly to politics, or split it into two (politics and everything else). Most subjects I’m passionate enough to write long articles or essays about have libertarianism/philosophy/poultics as a common denominator. Other subjects include:
            <ul className="indent-20 my-2"><span className="font-bold py-1 text-yellow-500">Announcements: </span>Any major changes or updates to this blog, myself (and future contributors), or our community will be under this category. </ul>
            <ul className="indent-20 my-2"><span className="font-bold py-1 text-yellow-500">Miscellaneous: </span>This category will be used for anthing that doesn't neatly fit into any of the other categories.</ul>
            <ul className="indent-20 my-2"><span className="font-bold py-1 text-yellow-500">News: </span>This one is self-explanatory and will usually have another category to go along with it. In the case of this blog, it will most commonly be associated with a political event or the entertainment industry (eg, the release of a new TV show or album). </ul>
            <ul className="indent-20 my-2"><span className="font-bold py-1 text-yellow-500">Books: </span>I love to read. For the most part, I have settled into a libertarian world view, but it’s important to me that I continue to challenge myself, remain open-minded, maintain the dialogue, and keep learning. like many ideologues, libertarians can also devolve into consuming content that only affirms their beliefs. Indeed, one could argue that is why Republicans and Democrats are so dogmatic; because they basically live in a cultural echo chamber. libertarians are much smaller in number and surrounded by those with different views challenging their beliefs. For that reason, I believe they tend to be more objective and well-read. However, the danger still exists by reading nothing but Ludwig von Mises or listening to David Smith 24/7 that libertarians could become just as uncompromising as someone who only ever listens to Rush Limbaugh or reads Karl Marx. <p className="indent-10">Consequently, I only read “affirmative” works every once in a while. I have not drowned myself in libertarian literature or content like many other libertarians have. I usually prefer reading generally politically neutral works or those opposing my own, especially journalistic or scholarly research with ostensibly neutral political opinions and devoid of an agenda. Of course, being educated is important, whether political or not, but my primary goal is to constantly challenge my libertarian views, not only those of others. Then, if the authors make a good case, or even if they don't, how does it apply to the libertarian movement and thought. What can we learn from the author's thesis? Works like "Why Nations Fail" (a scholarly and non-potical book) by Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson propose that societies with inclusive or exclusive structures determine their success and failure. That would support a libertarian society where everyone has the same opportunities and rights. “Mississippi Praying: Southern White Evangelicals and the Civil Rights Movement, 1945-1975” by Carolyn Renee Dupont, a University of Kentucky professor running for Congress as a Democrat, makes a compelling case that movements are more successful when focused on issues instead of broad philosophical conversions.</p></ul>
            <ul className="indent-20 my-2"><span className="font-bold py-1 text-yellow-500">Lifestyle: </span>During a toxic relationship I was in for a few years, I really let myself go. After the breakup, I was determined to “fix my mojo,” regain my confidence on a personal level, and eventually find the right woman. Since then, I have reprioritized being the best version of myself I can be, but with more nuance and understanding. I am now a huge fan of Youtubers like Alpha m, Real Men Real Style, 40 Over Fashion, and others. I have also started including more psychology and self-improvement books in my reading pattern. This has led to an interest in learning and writing about men’s lifestyle topics, best practices, and strategies. </ul>
            <ul className="indent-20 my-2"><span className="font-bold py-1 text-yellow-500">Movies/TV: </span>Compromise and civil discourse are important to me. Simply assuming or jumping to conclusions is a pet peeve. I am a pragmatic libertarian who doesn’t believe a “libertarian utopia” will ever be possible, and that requires compromise with whom we disagree. I also converted to libertarianism at a time when anyone who disagreed with the Iraq War or Patriot Act was called a terrorist lover by Republicans. Nowadays, the ideological script has been flipped and anyone who disagrees with the woke movement or BLM, for example, is automatically a white supremacist, racist, mysoginist, or homophobe. Movies and TV shows are the perfect example of this. <p className="indent-10">Over the last few years, I've gradually become fascinated by movie and TV show writing. Especially since the woke movement has ruined everything I love, franchise by franchise. Growing up, my dad would always nitpick movies or tv shows to death, especially the science or military tactics used in them. So, I’ve always kind of done that too, even when I generally liked them.  At first, as the woke movement kept getting called out by conservatives, I abstractly believed the narrative that they were indeed being racist, sexist, and homophobic. Being from Mississippi where a lot of whites are exactly that and all conservative, it made sense. I believed a lot of the liberal hype and propaganda. However, I just didn’t pay a lot of attention to it. I was generally disappointed with the Star Wars sequels. Then Star Trek Discovery came out, and I hated it. Before it came out, I was upset they were doing yet another prequel, but was excitedMichelle Yeoh and Sonequa Martin-Green would be playing leading roles. But I didn’t connect the dots and realize how deeply the show was connected to this malevolent agenda which I really didn’t understand. Then Picard came out, and I hated it even more. Then the last few Marvel movies. Then Halo. </p><p className="indent-10">Finally, I asked myself, why do all of these SUCK so much. All this was happening as I was getting involved in politics and digging a lot deeper into topics, and it finally clicked. I’ve always been passionate about movies and TV, especially sci-fi and ones with strong messages and a vision for the future. Star Trek had utopian ideals of overcoming prejudice and unification through reason and science. Battlestar Galactica dealt with overcoming differences to survive. Star Wars dealt with hope for a better future and not restraining your dreams. Babylon 5 dealt with many of the same themes, but also fascism and civil war. These are all being corrupted by “reverse” racism, misandry, and cisphobia, not to mention the woke agenda that seeks to divide, censor those not like them, repress and oppress those they believe repressed and oppressed them for centuries, suppress any critical thinking, encourage double standards, and demonize or ruin all that came before. </p><p className="indent-10">I’ve had enough and plan to contribute my own reviews from a critical perspective as a normal reviewer and also from a political perspective. Just because I do not agree with a message does not mean it will necessitate a bad review from me. Star Trek is still one of my favorite franchises, despite its obvious love for socialism. The Expanse has a very dystopian view of a “wild west” in space. Sci-fi is all about expressing a possible future, what our world might look like under certain circumstances. If that doesn’t line up with my ideals, that’s ok. It adds to the dialogue, it’s intriguing to see, and sparks critical thinking. However, when modern politics takes priority over good writing, a good story, and good characters, that is where I draw the line. All these stories already had great messages and morals to their story. I can understand how they might want to "diversify" them. I've been there too. I was annoyed by casting choices of the Ancient One in Dr. Strange and the lead in Iron Fist. Enterprise devolved into a mostly white, male crew. However, it had no effect on the writing (except Iron Fist, which was horrible). However, modern diversification is synonymous with pandering and tokenization. It's not truly diverse and it takes priority over everything else. And the clearly obvious insertions of political agendas instead of critically thoughtful perspectives completely takes you out of the world.</p></ul>
            <ul className="indent-20 my-2"><span className="font-bold py-1 text-yellow-500">Music: </span>I love to play the piano, though I’m not very good. At one point, I knew about 8 songs. I’m a huge connoisseur,  however, and can find value in all genres. I have a special place in my heart however for symphonic power metal and similar genres, genres that are obscure in the US and poorly covered, even internationally, from a blogging perspective. Album reviews, state of the industry/genre, lyrical content, etc all things I would like to cover. For example, I’ve been dying to write about the song “Zombified” by Falling in Reverse for weeks now. Not only does the music kick ass, but the lyrics perfectly sum up America at the moment (see: politics as a common denominator). </ul>
            <ul className="indent-20 my-2"><span className="font-bold py-1 text-yellow-500">Politics: </span> </ul>
            <ul className="indent-20 my-2"><span className="font-bold py-1 text-yellow-500">Tech: </span>Of course, as an aspiring software developer, I love to keep up with modern technologies. Not only software-related, but tech in general. I am intrigued by trends especially. The evolution in streaming video and its effect on the cable/entertainment industry, augmented/virtual reality, electric vehicles, Android, Twitch, video conferencing, Starlink, 5G, and more. Software wise, new technologies are constantly being released and work flows being updated. As I learn about them and try them out, I would like to write about them. Lexical.js, for example, is a new text editor still in beta made by Facebook to replace Draft.js. I have tried it and would like to write about it. GraphQL is a new query language I am learning and absolutely loving. I would love to share my story as a self-taught developer. </ul>
